# simple_OCR_copying_from_image
## Image_OCR_Text (OpenCV)

Using PyTessaract to create OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from an image file in Python 

## Packages used in the Project 
1. TKinter
2. PyTessaract
3. OpenCV


## Initial Setup 
### 1. tkinter package 
for taking Input of an image from the user
```
pip install tk
```
### 2. PyTessaract package
to recognize text from the image
```
pip install pytesseract
```
### 2. OpenCV package
to read an image and perform certain image-processing techniques
```
pip install opencv-python
```
### 3. Save an image you want to extract text from 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. If that didn't work then you can try these [commands](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/)
> 2. If there is still a problem then you can install through a .whl file for that particular [package](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/python/how-do-i-install-a-python-package-with-a-whl-file.html) 

## Test Drive 

1. Run the file "main.py" in the initial directory
2. Enter the path for the image.
3. Open the "extracted_text.txt" file created after running the program.

> [!NOTE]
> 1. Remember to perform the initial setup before test-driving
> 2. You can also directly run "test2.py" or "test3.py" files they have different preprocessing applied to them.
